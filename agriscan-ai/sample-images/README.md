# Sample Drone Images

This directory contains sample drone images for demonstrating the AgriScan AI application.

In a real implementation, this would contain actual JPG/PNG drone imagery of agricultural fields.

Sample images would include:
- field1.jpg - Wheat field with pest infestation
- field2.png - Corn field with nutrient deficiency
- field3.jpg - Soybean field with healthy growth
- field4.png - Rice field with irrigation issues

These images would be used in the demo to showcase the pest detection, nutrient analysis, and yield prediction capabilities.
